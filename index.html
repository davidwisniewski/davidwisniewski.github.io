	<p>My research focuses on the neural basis of intentional action, and how it is affected by changing environmental demands and motivational processes. 
	I am further interested in the functional architecture of the cognitive and intentional control brain networks. To investigate these issues, 
	I mainly combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multivariate pattern analysis and computational modelling techniques. 
	Additionally, I investigate free will beliefs, and how these differ within a population and between cultures, by means of large scale questionnaire 
	studies.
