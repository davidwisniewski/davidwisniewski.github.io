	<p> 
	I am a cognitive neuroscientists and Marie Curie Fellow at Ghent University. My research focuses on the neural basis of intentional action and 
	how it is affected by motivational processes, and the functional architecture of the cognitive control network. To Investigate these issues,
	I combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multivariate pattern analysis and computational modelling techniques. 
	I am further interested in free will beliefs, and how these differ within a population and between cultures.
