	<p> 
	I am a cognitive neuroscientists and Marie Curie Fellow at Ghent University. My research focuses on the neural basis of intentional action 
	and how it is affected by motivational processes. To investigate this issue, I combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 
	machine learning, and computational modelling techniques. I am also interested in free will beliefs, and how such beliefs affect our behavior.
