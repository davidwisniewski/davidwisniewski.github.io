	<p> 
	I am a cognitive neuroscientists and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Ghent University. My research focuses on the neural representations of intentional action 
	and how they change under varying task demands. To investigate this issue, I combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 
	machine learning, and computational modelling techniques. I am also interested in free will beliefs, how they affect our behavior, and how they are related to attitudes about free will.
