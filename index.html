	<p>I investigate the neural basis of human intentional action and how it is affected by changing environmental demands and motivational processes. My research focuses on the 
	neural representations of intentions, and how they are affected by dynamically changing conditions such as rewards, difficulty, or aversive outcomes. I am also interested in the 
	functional architecture of the cognitive and intentional control brain networks. To investigate these issues, I combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multivariate 
	pattern analysis methods.</p>
