	<h2>Behavioral tasks</h2>
	
	<h3>CATegorization Task</h3>
	<p>
	In this task, participants classify morphed images of cats and dogs. The code is written in jspych, and is to be used to acquire data online.<br>

	</p>
	
	<h3>Questionnaires</h3>
	<p>
	If you want to present questionnaires in your PeychoPy experiment, you can use this code as a platform. It already contains a few quesionnaires to start with, but can be easily expanded.<br>

	</p>
	
	<h2>fMRI</h2>
	
	Here, you can find a few helper functions / example scripts to set up your fMRI analysis, from prepprocessing to multivariate analyses.
	
	<h3>Preprocessing</h3>
	<p>
	This script is written in Matlab / SPM12. It offers a simple, modular way to preprocess fMRI data. It has been written with the scanner parameters of the Siemens Prisma in mind, but can be easily adapted.<br>

	</p>
	
	<h3>Mask Extraction</h3>
	<p>
	If you need to extract ROI masks automatically, you can use this small Matlab script. It takes the Human Connectome Atlas and lets you extract and save (as .nii) any mask you want from it. The script also allows you to dilate and/or combine masks easily.<br>

	</p>
	
	<h3>RSA analysis</h3>
	<p>
	This script will help you set up your ROI-based representational similarity analysis using Matlab / SPM12 / The Decoding Toolbox. You can easily adapt it to your needs. <br>
